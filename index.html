	<p><strong>Pizza</strong> is a yeasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatbread">flatbread</a> generally topped with <em>tomato sauce</em> and <em>cheese</em> and baked in an oven. It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, vegetables and condiments. The term was first recorded in the <time>10th century</time>, in a Latin manuscript from Gaeta in Central Italy.[1] The modern pizza was invented in Naples, Italy, and the dish and its variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world.[2]</p>

	<p>In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was safeguarded in the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish.[3][4] The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (the True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples. It promotes and protects the "true Neapolitan pizza".[5]</p>

	<p>Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, either whole or in portions, and is a common fast food item in Europe and North America.[6] Various types of ovens are used to cook them and many varieties exist. Several similar dishes are prepared from ingredients commonly used in pizza preparation, such as calzone and stromboli.</p>
